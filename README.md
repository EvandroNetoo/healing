## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is an online consultation system developed using the Django framework, along with technologies like Crispy Forms for more elegant forms and i18n for internationalization support. Additionally, the development environment is managed by Docker Compose, ensuring consistency and ease of configuration across different environments. The database used is PostgreSQL (psql), providing robustness and scalability to the system.
